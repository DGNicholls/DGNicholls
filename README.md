- 👋 Hi, I’m @DGNicholls
- 👀 I’m interested in camera trapping to monitor ground dwelling small mammals in Victoria, Austrlia. With help, I am using R to manage the data and produce its analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and aspiring to learn python so that I migh increase my skills in Arc GIS Pro and QGIS.
